🤺 Favero 05 to OBS Wireless BridgeA low-latency, wireless automation system that connects a Favero 05 Full Arm fencing machine to OBS Studio. Using two Wemos D1 Mini (ESP8266) modules and ESP-NOW, this system triggers broadcast-style overlays the millisecond a hit is detected.⚡ Quick Start ChecklistBefore running the system, ensure these non-obvious configurations are complete:[ ] MAC Address: Copy the Receiver's MAC address into the receiverAddress[] array in the Transmitter code1.[ ] COM Port: Identify the Receiver's COM port in Device Manager and update COM_PORT in Favero_OBS_Bridge.py.[ ] OBS Auth: Enable WebSocket authentication in OBS and copy the password into the Python script.[ ] Naming: Ensure your OBS Scene is named Main and your sources are Red_Light, Green_Light, White_Red_Light, and White_Green_Light 22.+1[ ] Serial Lock: Close the Arduino Serial Monitor before starting the Python script.🛠 Hardware ArchitectureComponentRoleConnectionTransmitterParses Favero data & broadcasts via ESP-NOWFavero Serial $\rightarrow$ RS232-TTL $\rightarrow$ Wemos RX 3333+2ReceiverListens for ESP-NOW & bridges to USBWemos USB $\rightarrow$ Laptop COM Port 44+1LaptopRuns Python Bridge & OBS StudioInterprets Serial DATA, strings 5🚀 Installation & Setup1.

OBS ConfigurationNavigate to Tools → obs-websocket Settings.Enable the server and note your password (default port is 4455).In your "Main" scene, create four sources (Image or Color) with these exact names:Red_LightGreen_LightWhite_Red_LightWhite_Green_Light 83. Python EnvironmentInstall the required dependencies via terminal:Bashpip install pyserial obs-websocket-py
💻 Running the BridgePlug the Receiver into the laptop.Launch OBS Studio.Execute the bridge script:Bashpython Favero_OBS_Bridge.py
📝 Data ProtocolThe Receiver sends data to the laptop in a CSV format for high-speed parsing:DATA,Red,Green,WhiteRed,WhiteGreen,LeftScore,RightScore,Min,Sec 9⚠️ TroubleshootingLights Inverted? Swap the names of your sources in OBS or adjust the SOURCE_MAP in the Python script 10.No Connection? Check the Baud Rate. The Transmitter talks to the Favero at 2400, but the Receiver talks to the laptop at 11520011111111.+1Laggy Clock? Ensure TEST_MODE is false in the Transmitter to stop simulated data from flooding the stream.
